# Motor recovery depends on early disk surgery in patients with acute lumbar radiculopathy

**BACKGROUND**

Patients with sciatica and no or minor neurologic deficits due to lumbar disk herniations (LDH) undergo at least 6 weeks of conservative care, while LDH-associated cauda equine syndrome is considered a surgical emergency. Even though delaying disk surgery is ill-advised in major or progressive radicular motor deficits, the timing of surgery has not been well studied and no timing threshold has been identified.

**METHODS**

In a single-center trial, we prospectively followed a total of 390 patients with LDH-associated motor deficits for a minimum of 12 months after non-elective microscopic disk surgery. The duration of the motor deficit prior to surgery was documented. Timing of surgery depended on the delay in patient presentation plus on imaging and OR availability. Motor function was graded in a standardized fashion at baseline and at repeated follow-up using manual muscle testing according to the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. Statistical analysis of motor recovery focused on unbiased recursive partitioning conditional inference tree (URP-CTREE) of the slope of recovery calculated as change of the MRC grade over time.
